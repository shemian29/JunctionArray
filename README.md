# New regimes of junction arrays

1. Build an explicit wave function for the eigen-
states on the charge lattice
2. Clarify how degeneracy arises in the spectrum
3. Determine the lowest-order correction to ener-
gies and wave function when EJa is included
perturbatively.
4. Perform parameter sweeps of matrix elements
of the operators of the system as a function of:
N, ECa,b, EJa,b, external flux and off-set charge.
This include matrix elements among all the first-
excited states and the ground state.
5. Use explicit expressions of wave functions to
study matrix elements in the EJa = 0 limit.
